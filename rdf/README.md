# RDF Datasets

This folder contains the RDF datasets used in the project, due to practical reasons, we uploaded the datasets in a different folder through a self hosted LFS, therefore it's not accessible on GitHub.

The datasets are divided in 3 macro areas:

+ Pollution - Vehicle Traffic
+ Roads and Projects
+ Road Accidents
